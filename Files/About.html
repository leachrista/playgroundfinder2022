    Playgroundfinder is based in Vienna, Austria. We are a very small team of 4 students.
    We are all understanding the need to get kids outside to play.
    Development is motivated by our very energetic kids! Our hope is to make it easy for you be active
    and have fun with your kids outside.
    Playgroundfinder is a community resource that depends on you to keep it up to date with the best possible playground information.
